== Description ==
This plugin is for WooCommerce. At the moment, minimal functionality is offered, but it will expand over time. What our plugin does at the moment:
* the plugin adds a custom field on the checkout page where the buyer is invited to click on the link to receive notifications about the order status change via the Telegram messenger;
* the plugin adds a page in the admin panel for setting up a Telenote service account and setting up the notifications themselves;
* the plugin is able to send notifications to the client and the administrator about the creation of an order and about a change in the order status.
* the text of messages can be customized using different placeholders.
